## Welcome to my profileðŸ‘‹

My name is Max, I have been a developer since 2020, starting in 2022 I specialize in the .NET Core/ASP.NET Core platform. 
On this Gidhub I post my libraries to facilitate coding on this platform, fork attractive projects in order to complement or create an alternative to them. Also here are my demo pet projects. 

## Collaboration

If you are also a developer with a similar stack and a desire to do something cool together, I am always open to collaboration.
